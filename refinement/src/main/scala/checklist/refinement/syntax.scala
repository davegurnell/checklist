// package checklist.refinement

/**
* Provides rule-builder style methods for refining types during the validation process.
*
* This can be useful for situations where your input types may be raw user input data which you validate, and then from that
* validation you gain additional context.
*
* Consider The example below:
* {{{
* case class InputFoo(untrimmed: String, maybeEmptyList: List[Int], name: String)
* case class ValidatedFoo(trimmed: String, nonEmptyList: NonEmptyList[Int], name: String, thing: Double)
*
* val rule =
*   Rule.builder[InputFoo]
*     .check("untrimmed", _.untrimmed)(Rule.trimString)
*     .check("maybeEmptyList", _.maybeEmptyList)(Rule.nonEmptyList)
*     .pass(_.name) // No validation will be performed, but the value for name will be passed through.
*     .append(util.Random.nextDouble()) // Appends a random double to the output type
*     .build[ValidatedFoo]
*
* rule(InputFoo("bar ", List("baz"))) // Ior.Right(ValidatedFoo("bar", NonEmptyList("baz")))
* rule(InputFoo("bar", List()) // Ior.Left(NonEmptyList(ErrorMessage("Must not be empty", PField("maybeEmptyList", PNil))))
* }}}
*
* A user has input an untrimmed string, and a list that may be empty.   During the sanitization and validation process, the
* string is trimmed, and then the List[Int] becomes a NonEmptyList[Int]. This is because the sanitization process can refine the
* type and hold on to context from the validation phase. This could also be used in conjunction with things like string parsing
* engines to accept user input strings, parse them in to your AST during sanitization/validation.
